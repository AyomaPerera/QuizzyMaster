# QuizzyMaster
This is a desktop based simple quiz application
In this project, I have created an attractive small quiz application. This project deals with the development of a Desktop-Based quiz application namely “QuizzyMaster”. This application is developed for educational purposes and allows the users to prepare the multiple-choice questions for different examinations. This application was developed to overcome the time-consuming problem of a manual system and to continue holding assignments and small exams during pandemic periods like now. In this application, the users do not need to have advanced computing knowledge to use this system. This system helps the examiners to manage their service in a good way and provide a better service to their users.

Here I used,
NetBeans IDE
Java
JFrame
MySQL
Xampp Server


This is a simple quiz application that allows a teacher to punch MCQ questions into the system which will be stored in the MySQL database and allows students to attempt tests. The test automatically stops when quiz time is over. The marks of students will be calculated according to the questions, and the attempt and will be displayed by the system to both teachers and students.
